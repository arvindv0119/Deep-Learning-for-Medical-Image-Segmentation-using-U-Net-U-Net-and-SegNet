# Deep-Learning-for-Medical-Image-Segmentation-using-U-Net-U-Net-and-SegNet
-Implemented U-Net, U-Net++ and SegNet architectures for semantic segmentation tasks, optimizing with Dice loss to handle class imbalance effectively.
-Conducted comparative analysis of model performance, achieving improved segmentation accuracy and robustness across architectures.
-Applied advanced deep learning techniques (convolutional neural networks, encoderâ€“decoder frameworks, skip connections) to build scalable, high-performing 
 segmentation pipelines in Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
 Here are the results,
Unet  :- dice_coef : 0.7726 & val_dice_coef: 0.6751
Unet++ :- Accuracy :0.9892 & loss: 0.0345
SegNet :-  Dice_coef: 0.9410, val_dice_coef :0.7521 ,lose: 0.0590 &accuracy:.9976
